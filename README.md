WorldTree
=========
WorldTree is a constrained random map generator.

It tries to generate random two-dimensional maps while satisfying the constraints specified.
WorldTree takes in a 'init.properties' and 'world.definitions' file as input and uses these to generate a world.

WorldTree is a work in progress and thus is extremely far from being complete.
Any views and suggestions are welcome.


Requirements
============

WorldTree requires JavaCC for its internal parser.
It is also recommended to link in JUnit4 libraries for unit testing.
